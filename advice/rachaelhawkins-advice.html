			<h4>Be patient!</h4>
			<p>It's so easy to get discouraged or get down on yourself when you aren't as fast as you want to be, or when you don't instantly absorb All The Knowledge. Be patient, keep reminding yourself that you're just learning and you're not in any rush.</p>

			<p>Slow down and take all the time you need. Keep telling yourself that it's more important to go slowly and learn everything well than it is to learn everything as fast as possible. You are awesome and you can do this!</p>

			<h4>Ask for help, look for help.</h4>
			<p>Ask the people around you when you don't understand! Look online for the answers! Try a thing, and if it doesn't work, look for more answers, and try again. Keep trying! Making mistakes, reading others' stories, and trying again is how you learn new things.</p>

			<p>Both instructors and the Internet are glad to offer you solutions if you are able to ask or look, so it's important to take advantage of the resources that you have. Banging your head against your desk repeatedly helps nothing!</p>

			<p>It's important to make mistakes and keep learning. It will all make you into a better programmer!</p>
